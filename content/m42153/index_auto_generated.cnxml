    <para id="import-auto-id2017129">Our own bodies, like all living organisms, are energy conversion machines. Conservation of energy implies that the chemical energy stored in food is converted into work, thermal energy, and/or stored as chemical energy in fatty tissue. (See <link target-id="import-auto-id1509596"/>.) The fraction going into each form depends both on how much we eat and on our level of physical activity. If we eat more than is needed to do work and stay warm, the remainder goes into body fat.</para>

Food energy is converted into work, thermal energy, and stored fat depicted by an arrow branching out of food energy and ending at these three forms. Stored fat plus thermal energy is equal to the final other energy, labeled  O E sub f, and nonconservative work is shown by W sub n c, which is negative, so the initial other energy, labeled O E sub i, plus W sub n c is equal to O E sub f .">

The total energy conversion rate of a person <emphasis effect="italics">at rest</emphasis> is called the <term id="import-auto-id2859421">basal metabolic rate</term> (BMR) and is divided among various systems in the body, as shown in <link target-id="import-auto-id2209139"/>. The largest fraction goes to the liver and spleen, with the brain coming next. Of course, during vigorous exercise, the energy consumption of the skeletal muscles and heart increase markedly. About 75% of the calories burned in a day go into these basic functions. The BMR is a function of age, gender, total body weight, and amount of muscle mass (which burns more calories than body fat). Athletes have a greater BMR due to this last factor. </para>

Useful work requires a force exerted through a distance on the outside world, and so it excludes internal work, such as that done by the heart when pumping blood. Useful work does include that done in climbing stairs or accelerating to a full run, because these are accomplished by exerting forces on the outside world. Forces exerted by the body are nonconservative, so that they can change the mechanical energy (<m:math><m:semantics><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mtext>KE </m:mtext><m:mo stretchy="false">+</m:mo><m:mtext> PE</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:mrow><m:mrow/></m:mrow><m:annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{"KE "+" PE"} {}</m:annotation></m:semantics></m:math>) of the system worked upon, and this is often the goal.

</table><para xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" id="import-auto-id1208199">All bodily functions, from thinking to lifting weights, require energy. (See <link target-id="import-auto-id1770894"/>.) The many small muscle actions accompanying all quiet activity, from sleeping to head scratching, ultimately become thermal energy, as do less visible muscle actions by the heart, lungs, and digestive tract. Shivering, in fact, is an involuntary response to low body temperature that pits muscles against one another to produce thermal energy in the body (and do no work). The kidneys and liver consume a surprising amount of energy, but the biggest surprise of all it that a full 25% of all energy consumed by the body is used to maintain electrical potentials in all living cells. (Nerve cells use this electrical potential in nerve impulses.) This bioelectrical energy ultimately becomes mostly thermal energy, but some is utilized to power chemical processes such as in the kidneys and liver, and in fat production.</para><figure xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" id="import-auto-id1770894"><media id="import-auto-id1732754" alt="An f M R I scan of a human head with energy consumption in the vision center shown by a bright spot.
