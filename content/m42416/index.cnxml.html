        <p id="import-auto-id1169736657076">Electricity has two hazards. A <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1169736588235">thermal hazard</span> occurs when there is electrical overheating. A <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1169737712452">shock hazard</span> occurs when electric current passes through a person. Both hazards have already been discussed. Here we will concentrate on systems and devices that prevent electrical hazards.</p>

Modern household and industrial wiring requires the <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1169737882981">three-wire system</span>, shown schematically in <a href="#import-auto-id1169737831002" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, which has several safety features. First is the familiar <em data-effect="italics">circuit breaker</em> (or <em data-effect="italics">fuse</em>) to prevent thermal overload. Second, there is a protective <em data-effect="italics">case</em> around the appliance, such as a toaster or refrigerator. The case&#8217;s safety feature is that it prevents a person from touching exposed wires and coming into electrical contact with the circuit, helping prevent shocks.</p>

Recall that an earth/ground connection is a low-resistance path directly to the earth. The two earth/ground connections on the <em data-effect="italics">neutral wire</em> force it to be at zero volts relative to the earth, giving the wire its name. This wire is therefore safe to touch even if its insulation, usually white, is missing. The neutral wire is the return path for the current to follow to complete the circuit. Furthermore, the two earth/ground connections supply an alternative path through the earth, a good conductor, to complete the circuit. The earth/ground connection closest to the power source could be at the generating plant, while the other is at the user&#8217;s location.

        </figure><p id="import-auto-id1169738008710">A note on insulation color-coding: Insulating plastic is color-coded to identify live/hot, neutral and ground wires but these codes vary around the world. Live/hot wires may be brown, red, black, blue or grey. Neutral wire may be blue, black or white. Since the same color may be used for live/hot or neutral in different parts of the world, it is essential to determine the color code in your region. The only exception is the earth/ground wire which is often green but may be yellow or just bare wire. Striped coatings are sometimes used for the benefit of those who are colorblind.</p>
        <p id="import-auto-id1169736989256">The three-wire system replaced the older two-wire system, which lacks an earth/ground wire. Under ordinary circumstances, insulation on the live/hot and neutral wires prevents the case from being directly in the circuit, so that the earth/ground wire may seem like double protection. Grounding the case solves more than one problem, however. The simplest problem is worn insulation on the live/hot wire that allows it to contact the case, as shown in <a href="#import-auto-id1169737812648" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. Lacking an earth/ground connection (some people cut the third prong off the plug because they only have outdated two hole receptacles), a severe shock is possible. This is particularly dangerous in the kitchen, where a good connection to earth/ground is available through water on the floor or a water faucet. With the earth/ground connection intact, the circuit breaker will trip, forcing repair of the appliance. Why are some appliances still sold with two-prong plugs? These have nonconducting cases, such as power tools with impact resistant plastic cases, and are called <em data-effect="italics"><em data-effect="italics">doubly insulated</em></em>. Modern two-prong plugs can be inserted into the asymmetric standard outlet in only one way, to ensure proper connection of live/hot and neutral wires.</p>

GFIs compare the currents in the live/hot and neutral wires. When live/hot and neutral currents are not equal, it is almost always because current in the neutral is less than in the live/hot wire. Then some of the current, again called a leakage current, is returning to the voltage source by a path other than through the neutral wire. It is assumed that this path presents a hazard, such as shown in <a href="#import-auto-id1169738239640" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. GFIs are usually set to interrupt the circuit if the leakage current is greater than 5 mA, the accepted maximum harmless shock.

But there is not a complete circuit for current to flow through the person in the figure, who is touching only one of the transformer&#8217;s output wires, and neither output wire is grounded. The appliance is isolated from the original voltage source by the high resistance of the material between the transformer coils, hence the name isolation transformer.

One end of the AC circuit is connected to a circuit breaker. The other end of the circuit breaker is connected to an appliance. The appliance is shown as a resistance enclosed in a rectangular metal case known as the case of appliance. The other end of the resistance is connected back to the AC source through a connecting wire. The connecting wire and the A C source are grounded. The ground terminal at the appliance case is connected to a resistance R g equals zero point two ohms. A person is shown to hold one hand on the appliance case.
