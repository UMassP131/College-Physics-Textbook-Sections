    <p id="import-auto-id1635012">Einstein is said to have been fascinated by a compass as a child, perhaps musing on how the needle felt a force without direct physical contact. His ability to think deeply and clearly about action at a distance, particularly for gravitational, electric, and magnetic forces, later enabled him to create his revolutionary theory of relativity. Since magnetic forces act at a distance, we define a <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id2568566">magnetic field</span> to represent magnetic forces. The pictorial representation of <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1837998">magnetic field lines</span> is very useful in visualizing the strength and direction of the magnetic field. As shown in <a href="#import-auto-id1636233" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, the <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id2415022">direction of magnetic field lines</span>  is defined to be the direction in which the north end of a compass needle points. The magnetic field is traditionally called the <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1797630"><em data-effect="italics">B</em>-field</span>.</p><figure id="import-auto-id1636233"><figcaption>Magnetic field lines are defined to have the direction that a small compass points when placed at a location. (a) If small compasses are used to map the magnetic field around a bar magnet, they will point in the directions shown: away from the north pole of the magnet, toward the south pole of the magnet. (Recall that the Earth&#8217;s north magnetic pole is really a south pole in terms of definitions of poles on a bar magnet.) (b) Connecting the arrows gives continuous magnetic field lines. The strength of the field is proportional to the closeness (or density) of the lines.

    <p id="import-auto-id2004843">A field is a way of mapping forces surrounding any object that can act on another object at a distance without apparent physical connection. The field represents the object generating it. Gravitational fields map gravitational forces, electric fields map electrical forces, and magnetic fields map magnetic forces.</p></div>

    <p id="import-auto-id1515368">Extensive exploration of magnetic fields has revealed a number of hard-and-fast rules. We use magnetic field lines to represent the field (the lines are a pictorial tool, not a physical entity in and of themselves). The properties of magnetic field lines can be summarized by these rules:</p><ol id="import-auto-id1921542" data-number-style="arabic">
      <li>The direction of the magnetic field is tangent to the field line at any point in space. A small compass will point in the direction of the field line.</li>
      <li>The strength of the field is proportional to the closeness of the lines. It is exactly proportional to the number of lines per unit area perpendicular to the lines (called the areal density).</li>
      <li>Magnetic field lines can never cross, meaning that the field is unique at any point in space.</li>
      <li>Magnetic field lines are continuous, forming closed loops without beginning or end. They go from the north pole to the south pole.</li>
    </ol>
    <p id="import-auto-id1734718">The last property is related to the fact that the north and south poles cannot be separated. It is a distinct difference from electric field lines, which begin and end on the positive and negative charges. If magnetic monopoles existed, then magnetic field lines would begin and end on them.</p>
