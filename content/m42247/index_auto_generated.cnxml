It will sing the same note back at you—the strings, having the same frequencies as your voice, are resonating in response to the forces from the sound waves that you sent to them. Your voice and a piano’s strings is a good example of the fact that objects—in this case, piano strings—can be forced to oscillate but oscillate best at their natural frequency. In this section, we shall briefly explore applying a <emphasis effect="italics">periodic driving force</emphasis> acting on a simple harmonic oscillator. The driving force puts energy into the system at a certain frequency, not necessarily the same as the natural frequency of the system. The <term id="import-auto-id2437470">natural frequency</term> is the frequency at which a system would oscillate if there were no driving and no damping force.</para><para id="import-auto-id2962800">Most of us have played with toys involving an object supported on an elastic band, something like the paddle ball suspended from a finger in <link target-id="import-auto-id1386289"/>. Imagine the finger in the figure is your finger. At first you hold your finger steady, and the ball bounces up and down with a small amount of damping. If you move your finger up and down slowly, the ball will follow along without bouncing much on its own. As you increase the frequency at which you move your finger up and down, the ball will respond by oscillating with increasing amplitude. When you drive the ball at its natural frequency, the ball’s oscillations increase in amplitude with each oscillation for as long as you drive it. The phenomenon of driving a system with a frequency equal to its natural frequency is called <term id="import-auto-id2393627">resonance</term>. A system being driven at its natural frequency is said to <term id="import-auto-id2990636">resonate</term>. As the driving frequency gets progressively higher than the resonant or natural frequency, the amplitude of the oscillations becomes smaller, until the oscillations nearly disappear and your finger simply moves up and down with little effect on the ball.</para>

In the first figure the ball is stretching up and down very slowly having less displacement, the displacement shown in the figures as faded shades of the ball and is depicted as 2X. Whereas in the second figure the movement of the ball is highest, while in the third the movement is least. In all the three figures the ball is at its equilibrium with respect to its movement. The frequency, f, for the first figure is very low, for the second figure as f not, while for the third figure it is highest.">

There are three curves on the graph, each representing a different amount of damping. All three curves peak at the point where the frequency of the driving force equals the natural frequency of the harmonic oscillator. The highest peak, or greatest response, is for the least amount of damping, because less energy is removed by the damping force.</para>

        <caption>Amplitude of a harmonic oscillator as a function of the frequency of the driving force. The curves represent the same oscillator with the same natural frequency but with different amounts of damping. Resonance occurs when the driving frequency equals the natural frequency, and the greatest response is for the least amount of damping. The narrowest response is also for the least damping. </caption></figure><para xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" id="import-auto-id2397034">It is interesting that the widths of the resonance curves shown in <link target-id="import-auto-id3047262"/> depend on damping: the less the damping, the narrower the resonance. The message is that if you want a driven oscillator to resonate at a very specific frequency, you need as little damping as possible. Little damping is the case for piano strings and many other musical instruments. Conversely, if you want small-amplitude oscillations, such as in a car’s suspension system, then you want heavy damping. Heavy damping reduces the amplitude, but the tradeoff is that the system responds at more frequencies.</para><para xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" id="import-auto-id1525320">These features of driven harmonic oscillators apply to a huge variety of systems. When you tune a radio, for example, you are adjusting its resonant frequency so that it only oscillates to the desired station’s broadcast (driving) frequency. The more selective the radio is in discriminating between stations, the smaller its damping. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used medical diagnostic tool in which atomic nuclei (mostly hydrogen nuclei) are made to resonate by incoming radio waves (on the order of 100 MHz). A child on a swing is driven by a parent at the swing’s natural frequency to achieve maximum amplitude. In all of these cases, the efficiency of energy transfer from the driving force into the oscillator is best at resonance. Speed bumps and gravel roads prove that even a car’s suspension system is not immune to resonance. In spite of finely engineered shock absorbers, which ordinarily convert mechanical energy to thermal energy almost as fast as it comes in, speed bumps still cause a large-amplitude oscillation. On gravel roads that are corrugated, you may have noticed that if you travel at the “wrong” speed, the bumps are very noticeable whereas at other speeds you may hardly feel the bumps at all. <link target-id="import-auto-id1908149"/> shows a photograph of a famous example (the Tacoma Narrows Bridge) of the destructive effects of a driven harmonic oscillation. The Millennium Bridge in London was closed for a short period of time for the same reason while inspections were carried out.</para><para xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" id="import-auto-id2679185">In our bodies, the chest cavity is a clear example of a system at resonance. The diaphragm and chest wall drive the oscillations of the chest cavity which result in the lungs inflating and deflating. The system is critically damped and the muscular diaphragm oscillates at the resonant value for the system, making it highly efficient.</para><figure xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" id="import-auto-id1908149"><media id="import-auto-id3122775" alt="The figure shows a black and white photo of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, from the left side view.

Damping decreased when support cables broke loose and started to slip over the towers, allowing increasingly greater amplitudes until the structure failed (credit: PRI's <emphasis effect="italics">Studio 360</emphasis>, via Flickr)</caption></figure><exercise id="fs-id2929352" type="check-understanding">
