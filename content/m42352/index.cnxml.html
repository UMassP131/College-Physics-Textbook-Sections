            <p id="import-auto-id2445562">Electric currents in the vastly complex system of billions of nerves in our body allow us to sense the world, control parts of our body, and think. These are representative of the three major functions of nerves. First, nerves carry messages from our sensory organs and others to the central nervous system, consisting of the brain and spinal cord. Second, nerves carry messages from the central nervous system to muscles and other organs. Third, nerves transmit and process signals within the central nervous system. The sheer number of nerve cells and the incredibly greater number of connections between them makes this system the subtle wonder that it is. <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1586959">Nerve conduction</span> is a general term for electrical signals carried by nerve cells. It is one aspect of <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id2680526">bioelectricity</span>, or electrical effects in and created by biological systems.</p>

The Coulomb force prevents the ions from diffusing across in their entirety. Once the charge layer has built up, the repulsion of like charges prevents more from moving across, and the attraction of unlike charges prevents more from leaving either side. The result is two layers of charge right on the membrane, with diffusion being balanced by the Coulomb force. A tiny fraction of the charges move across and the fluids remain neutral (other ions are present), while a separation of charge and a voltage have been created across the membrane.</p><figure id="import-auto-id1354923"><figcaption>The semipermeable membrane of a cell has different concentrations of ions inside and out.

The adjacent membrane depolarizes, affecting the membrane further down, and so on, as illustrated in <a href="#import-auto-id954471" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.

This arrangement gives the axon a number of interesting properties. Since myelin is an insulator, it prevents signals from jumping between adjacent nerves (cross talk). Additionally, the myelinated regions transmit electrical signals at a very high speed, as an ordinary conductor or resistor would. There is no action potential in the myelinated regions, so that no cell energy is used in them. There is an <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mstyle fontstyle="italic"><mrow><mtext>IR</mtext></mrow></mstyle></mrow><mrow/></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mstyle fontstyle="italic"><mrow><mtext>IR</mtext></mrow></mstyle></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{ ital "IR"} {}</annotation></semantics></annotation-xml></semantics></math> signal loss in the myelin, but the signal is regenerated in the gaps, where the voltage pulse triggers the action potential at full voltage. So a myelinated axon transmits a nerve impulse faster, with less energy consumption, and is better protected from cross talk than an unmyelinated one. Not all axons are myelinated, so that cross talk and slow signal transmission are a characteristic of the normal operation of these axons, another variable in the nervous system.</p>
            <p id="import-auto-id1569430">The degeneration or destruction of the myelin sheaths that surround the nerve fibers impairs signal transmission and can lead to numerous neurological effects. One of the most prominent of these diseases comes from the body&#8217;s own immune system attacking the myelin in the central nervous system&#8212;multiple sclerosis. MS symptoms include fatigue, vision problems, weakness of arms and legs, loss of balance, and tingling or numbness in one&#8217;s extremities (neuropathy). It is more apt to strike younger adults, especially females. Causes might come from infection, environmental or geographic affects, or genetics. At the moment there is no known cure for MS.</p>
            <p id="import-auto-id1397225">Most animal cells can fire or create their own action potential. Muscle cells contract when they fire and are often induced to do so by a nerve impulse. In fact, nerve and muscle cells are physiologically similar, and there are even hybrid cells, such as in the heart, that have characteristics of both nerves and muscles. Some animals, like the infamous electric eel (see <a href="#import-auto-id3158004" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>), use muscles ganged so that their voltages add in order to create a shock great enough to stun prey.</p>

For example, regions of damaged heart tissue, called infarcts, reflect electrical waves and are apparent in one or more lead potentials. Subtle changes due to slight or gradual damage to the heart are most readily detected by comparing a recent ECG to an older one. This is particularly the case since individual heart shape, size, and orientation can cause variations in ECGs from one individual to another. ECG technology has advanced to the point where a portable ECG monitor with a liquid crystal instant display and a printer can be carried to patients' homes or used in emergency vehicles.
