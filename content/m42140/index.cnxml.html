            </figure><p id="import-auto-id3130527">Many motions, such as the arc of a bird&#8217;s flight or Earth&#8217;s path around the Sun, are curved. Recall that Newton&#8217;s first law tells us that motion is along a straight line at constant speed unless there is a net external force. We will therefore study not only motion along curves, but also the forces that cause it, including gravitational forces. In some ways, this chapter is a continuation of <a href="/contents/02f52a02-2484-4ccb-bbd4-3c94edaa8e09@4">Dynamics: Newton's Laws of Motion</a> as we study more applications of Newton&#8217;s laws of motion.</p><p id="import-auto-id3172430">This chapter deals with the simplest form of curved motion, <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1920881">uniform circular motion</span>, motion in a circular path at constant speed. Studying this topic illustrates most concepts associated with rotational motion and leads to the study of many new topics we group under the name <em data-effect="italics">rotation</em>. Pure <em data-effect="italics">rotational motion</em> occurs when points in an object move in circular paths centered on one point. Pure <em data-effect="italics">translational motion</em> is motion with no rotation. Some motion combines both types, such as a rotating hockey puck moving along ice.</p>
