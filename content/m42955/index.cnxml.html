</p></section><section data-depth="1" id="import-auto-id1164015901024"><h1 data-type="title">To the Student</h1>
      <p id="import-auto-id1164034048325">This book is written for you. It is based on the teaching and research experience of numerous physicists and influenced by a strong recollection of their own struggles as students. After reading this book, we hope you see that physics is visible everywhere. Applications range from driving a car to launching a rocket, from a skater whirling on ice to a neutron star spinning in space, and from taking your temperature to taking a chest X-ray.</p>
    </section>
    <section data-depth="1" id="import-auto-id1164051231960"><h1 data-type="title">To the Instructor</h1>
      <p id="import-auto-id1164053581560">This text is intended for one-year introductory courses requiring algebra and some trigonometry, but no calculus. OpenStax provides the essential supplemental resources at http://openstaxcollege.org ; however, we have pared down the number of supplements to keep costs low.  College Physics can be easily customized for your course using Connexions (http://cnx.org/content/col11406). Simply select the content most relevant to your curriculum and create a textbook that speaks directly to the needs of your class. </p></section>
    <section data-depth="1" id="import-auto-id1164028434248"><h1 data-type="title">General Approach</h1>
      <p id="import-auto-id1164016080852">College Physics is organized such that topics are introduced conceptually with a steady progression to precise definitions and analytical applications. The analytical aspect (problem solving) is tied back to the conceptual before moving on to another topic. Each introductory chapter, for example, opens with an engaging photograph relevant to the subject of the chapter and interesting applications that are easy for most students to visualize. </p></section>
    <section data-depth="1" id="import-auto-id1164024853582"><h1 data-type="title">Organization, Level, and Content</h1>
      <p id="import-auto-id1164017731374">There is considerable latitude on the part of the instructor regarding the use, organization, level, and content of this book. By choosing the types of problems assigned, the instructor can determine the level of sophistication required of the student.</p></section>
    <section data-depth="1" id="import-auto-id1164036701301"><h1 data-type="title">Concepts and Calculations</h1>
      <p id="import-auto-id1164047449537">The ability to calculate does not guarantee conceptual understanding. In order to unify conceptual, analytical, and calculation skills within the learning process, we have integrated Strategies and Discussions throughout the text. </p></section>
    <section data-depth="1" id="import-auto-id1164029500775"><h1 data-type="title">Modern Perspective</h1>
      <p id="import-auto-id1164024085081">The chapters on modern physics are more complete than many other texts on the market, with an entire chapter devoted to medical applications of nuclear physics and another to particle physics. The final chapter of the text, &#8220;Frontiers of Physics,&#8221; is devoted to the most exciting endeavors in physics. It ends with a module titled &#8220;Some Questions We Know to Ask.&#8221; </p></section>
    <section data-depth="1" id="import-auto-id1164055420739"><h1 data-type="title">Supplements</h1>
      <p id="import-auto-id1164039312930">Accompanying the main text are a <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/textbooks/college-physics">Student Solutions Manual and an Instructor Solutions Manual</a>. The Student Solutions Manual provides worked-out solutions to select end-of-module Problems and Exercises. The Instructor Solutions Manual provides worked-out solutions to all Exercises.</p></section>
    <section data-depth="1" id="import-auto-id1164049519615"><h1 data-type="title">Features of OpenStax <em data-effect="italics">College Physics</em></h1><p id="import-auto-id1164023762640">The following briefly describes the special features of this text.</p>
      <section data-depth="2" id="import-auto-id1164035442836"><h2 data-type="title">Modularity</h2>
        <p id="import-auto-id1164041720235">This textbook is organized on Connexions (http://cnx.org) as a collection of modules that can be rearranged and modified to suit the needs of a particular professor or class. That being said, modules often contain references to content in other modules, as most topics in physics cannot be discussed in isolation. </p></section>
      <section data-depth="2" id="import-auto-id1164023904237"><h2 data-type="title">Learning Objectives</h2>
        <p id="import-auto-id1164039321492">Every module begins with a set of learning objectives. These objectives are designed to guide the instructor in deciding what content to include or assign, and to guide the student with respect to what he or she can expect to learn. After completing the module and end-of-module exercises, students should be able to demonstrate mastery of the learning objectives.</p>
      </section>
      <section data-depth="2" id="import-auto-id1164043441558"><h2 data-type="title">Call-Outs</h2>
        <p id="import-auto-id1164048985805">Key definitions, concepts, and equations are called out with a special design treatment. Call-outs are designed to catch readers&#8217; attention, to make it clear that a specific term, concept, or equation is particularly important, and to provide easy reference for a student reviewing content.</p>
      </section>
      <section data-depth="2" id="import-auto-id1164042885230"><h2 data-type="title">Key Terms</h2>
        <p id="import-auto-id1164024951353">Key terms are in bold and are followed by a definition in context. Definitions of key terms are also listed in the Glossary, which appears at the end of the module.</p>
      </section>
      <section data-depth="2" id="import-auto-id1164034544270"><h2 data-type="title">Worked Examples</h2>
        <p id="import-auto-id1164028550105">Worked examples have four distinct parts to promote both analytical and conceptual skills. Worked examples are introduced in words, always using some application that should be of interest. This is followed by a Strategy section that emphasizes the concepts involved and how solving the problem relates to those concepts. This is followed by the mathematical Solution and Discussion.</p><p id="import-auto-id1164039311314">Many worked examples contain multiple-part problems to help the students learn how to approach normal situations, in which problems tend to have multiple parts. Finally, worked examples employ the techniques of the problem-solving strategies so that students can see how those strategies succeed in practice as well as in theory.</p>
      </section>
      <section data-depth="2" id="import-auto-id1164029720883"><h2 data-type="title">Problem-Solving Strategies</h2>
        <p id="import-auto-id1164020368320">Problem-solving strategies are first presented in a special section and subsequently appear at crucial points in the text where students can benefit most from them. Problem-solving strategies have a logical structure that is reinforced in the worked examples and supported in certain places by line drawings that illustrate various steps.</p></section>
      <section data-depth="2" id="import-auto-id1164039331468"><h2 data-type="title">Misconception Alerts</h2>
        <p id="import-auto-id1164039313349">Students come to physics with preconceptions from everyday experiences and from previous courses. Some of these preconceptions are misconceptions, and many are very common among students and the general public. Some are inadvertently picked up through misunderstandings of lectures and texts. The Misconception Alerts feature is designed to point these out and correct them explicitly.</p>
      </section>
      <section data-depth="2" id="import-auto-id1164028426681"><h2 data-type="title">Take-Home Investigations</h2><p id="import-auto-id1164036643389">Take Home Investigations provide the opportunity for students to apply or explore what they have learned with a hands-on activity.</p>
      </section>
      <section data-depth="2" id="import-auto-id1164036619970"><h2 data-type="title">Things Great and Small</h2>
        <p id="import-auto-id1164039307318">In these special topic essays, macroscopic phenomena (such as air pressure) are explained with submicroscopic phenomena (such as atoms bouncing off walls). These essays support the modern perspective by describing aspects of modern physics before they are formally treated in later chapters. Connections are also made between apparently disparate phenomena.</p></section>
      <section data-depth="2" id="import-auto-id1164045616798"><h2 data-type="title">Simulations</h2>
        <p id="import-auto-id1164053363809">Where applicable, students are directed to the interactive PHeT physics simulations developed by the University of Colorado (<a href="http://phet.colorado.edu">http://phet.colorado.edu</a>). There they can further explore the physics concepts they have learned about in the module. </p></section>
      <section data-depth="2" id="import-auto-id1164023584175"><h2 data-type="title">Summary</h2>
        <p id="import-auto-id1164018351311">Module summaries are thorough and functional and present all important definitions and equations. Students are able to find the definitions of all terms and symbols as well as their physical relationships. The structure of the summary makes plain the fundamental principles of the module or collection and serves as a useful study guide.</p></section>
      <section data-depth="2" id="import-auto-id1164035153952"><h2 data-type="title">Glossary</h2>
        <p id="import-auto-id1164027757990">At the end of every module or chapter is a glossary containing definitions of all of the key terms in the module or chapter.</p></section>
      <section data-depth="2" id="import-auto-id1164066590357"><h2 data-type="title">End-of-Module Problems</h2>
        <p id="import-auto-id1164035089454">At the end of every chapter is a set of Conceptual Questions and/or skills-based Problems &amp; Exercises. Conceptual Questions challenge students&#8217; ability to explain what they have learned conceptually, independent of the mathematical details. Problems &amp; Exercises challenge students to apply both concepts and skills to solve mathematical physics problems. Online, every other problem includes an answer that students can reveal immediately by clicking on a &#8220;Show Solution&#8221; button. Fully worked solutions to select problems are available in the Student Solutions Manual and the Teacher Solutions Manual.</p><p id="import-auto-id1164023178597">In addition to traditional skills-based problems, there are three special types of end-of-module problems: Integrated Concept Problems, Unreasonable Results Problems, and Construct Your Own Problems. All of these problems are indicated with a subtitle preceding the problem.</p>
      </section>
      <section data-depth="2" id="import-auto-id1164039325143"><h2 data-type="title">Integrated Concept Problems</h2>
        <p id="import-auto-id1164022108943">In Integrated Concept Problems, students are asked to apply what they have learned about two or more concepts to arrive at a solution to a problem. These problems require a higher level of thinking because, before solving a problem, students have to recognize the combination of strategies required to solve it.</p></section>
      <section data-depth="2" id="import-auto-id1164027841192"><h2 data-type="title">Unreasonable Results</h2>
        <p id="import-auto-id1164035401574">In Unreasonable Results Problems, students are challenged to not only apply concepts and skills to solve a problem, but also to analyze the answer with respect to how likely or realistic it really is. These problems contain a premise that produces an unreasonable answer and are designed to further emphasize that properly applied physics must describe nature accurately and is not simply the process of solving equations.</p>
      </section>
      <section data-depth="2" id="import-auto-id1164023497148"><h2 data-type="title">Construct Your Own Problem</h2>
        <p id="import-auto-id1164034844288">These problems require students to construct the details of a problem, justify their starting assumptions, show specific steps in the problem&#8217;s solution, and finally discuss the meaning of the result. These types of problems relate well to both conceptual and analytical aspects of physics, emphasizing that physics must describe nature. Often they involve an integration of topics from more than one chapter. Unlike other problems, solutions are not provided since there is no single correct answer. Instructors should feel free to direct students regarding the level and scope of their considerations. Whether the problem is solved and described correctly will depend on initial assumptions.</p>
