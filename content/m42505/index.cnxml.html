Each wavelet in the figure was emitted when the wavefront crossed the interface between the media. Since the speed of light is smaller in the second medium, the waves do not travel as far in a given time, and the new wavefront changes direction as shown. This explains why a ray changes direction to become closer to the perpendicular when light slows down. Snell&#8217;s law can be derived from the geometry in <a href="#import-auto-id1169737080363" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, but this is left as an exercise for ambitious readers.</p><figure id="import-auto-id1169737080363"><figcaption>Huygens&#8217;s principle applied to a straight wavefront traveling from one medium to another where its speed is less.
