        <p id="import-auto-id3022820">It is well known that ionizing radiation affects us but does not trigger nerve impulses. Newspapers carry stories about unsuspecting victims of radiation poisoning who fall ill with radiation sickness, such as burns and blood count changes, but who never felt the radiation directly. This makes the detection of radiation by instruments more than an important research tool. This section is a brief overview of radiation detection and some of its applications.</p>
     
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id3017872"><h1 data-type="title">Human Application</h1>
        <p id="import-auto-id3165264">The first direct detection of radiation was Becquerel&#8217;s fogged photographic plate. Photographic film is still the most common detector of ionizing radiation, being used routinely in medical and dental x rays. Nuclear radiation is also captured on film, such as seen in <a href="#import-auto-id3076369" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. The mechanism for film exposure by ionizing radiation is similar to that by photons. A quantum of energy interacts with the emulsion and alters it chemically, thus exposing the film. The quantum  come from an <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>&#945;</mi></mrow><mrow/></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>&#945;</mi></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{&#945;} {}</annotation></semantics></annotation-xml></semantics></math>-particle, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>&#946;</mi></mrow><mrow/></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>&#946;</mi></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{&#946;} {}</annotation></semantics></annotation-xml></semantics></math>-particle, or photon, provided it has more than the few eV of energy needed to induce the chemical change (as does all ionizing radiation). The process is not 100% efficient, since not all incident radiation interacts and not all interactions produce the chemical change. The amount of film darkening is related to exposure, but the darkening also depends on the type of radiation, so that absorbers and other devices must be used to obtain energy, charge, and particle-identification information.</p><figure id="import-auto-id3076369"><figcaption>Film badges contain film similar to that used in  this dental x-ray film and is sandwiched between various absorbers to determine the penetrating ability of the radiation as well as the amount.

        </figure><p id="import-auto-id2056101">Another very common <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id2017624">radiation detector</span> is the <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id3177120">Geiger tube</span>. The clicking and buzzing sound we hear in dramatizations and documentaries, as well as in our own physics labs, is usually an audio output of events detected by a Geiger counter. These relatively inexpensive radiation detectors are based on the simple and sturdy Geiger tube, shown schematically in <a href="#import-auto-id3027822" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>(b). A conducting cylinder with a wire along its axis is filled with an insulating gas so that a voltage applied between the cylinder and wire produces almost no current. Ionizing radiation passing through the tube produces free ion pairs that are attracted to the wire and cylinder, forming a current that is detected as a count. The word count implies that there is no information on energy, charge, or type of radiation with a simple Geiger counter. They do not detect every particle, since some radiation can pass through without producing enough ionization to be detected. However, Geiger counters are very useful in producing a prompt output that reveals the existence and relative intensity of ionizing radiation.</p>

        </figure><p id="import-auto-id2679588">Another radiation detection method records light produced when radiation interacts with materials. The energy of the radiation is sufficient to excite atoms in a material that may fluoresce, such as the phosphor used by Rutherford&#8217;s group. Materials called <span data-type="term">scintillators</span> use a more complex collaborative process to convert radiation energy into light. Scintillators may be liquid or solid, and they can be very efficient. Their light output can provide information about the energy, charge, and type of radiation. Scintillator light flashes are very brief in duration, enabling the detection of a huge number of particles in short periods of time. Scintillator detectors are used in a variety of research and diagnostic applications. Among these are the detection by satellite-mounted equipment of the radiation from distant galaxies, the analysis of radiation from a person indicating body burdens, and the detection of exotic particles in accelerator laboratories.</p><p id="import-auto-id3234433">Light from a scintillator is converted into electrical signals by devices such as the <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id2929794">photomultiplier</span> tube shown schematically in <a href="#import-auto-id3089405" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. These tubes are based on the photoelectric effect, which is multiplied in stages into a cascade of electrons, hence the name photomultiplier. Light entering the photomultiplier strikes a metal plate, ejecting an electron that is attracted by a positive potential difference to the next plate, giving it enough energy to eject two or more electrons, and so on. The final output current can be made proportional to the energy of the light entering the tube, which is in turn proportional to the energy deposited in the scintillator. Very sophisticated information can be obtained with scintillators, including energy, charge, particle identification, direction of motion, and so on.</p>
       
    
        <figure id="import-auto-id3089405"><figcaption>Photomultipliers use the photoelectric effect on the photocathode to convert the light output of a scintillator into an electrical signal. Each successive dynode has a more-positive potential than the last and attracts the ejected electrons, giving them more energy. The number of electrons is thus multiplied at each dynode, resulting in an easily detected output current.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="import-auto-id2051574" data-alt="A cylindrical tube contains several curved plates labeled dynodes.

        </figure><p id="import-auto-id1817248"><span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id2589898">Solid-state radiation detectors</span> convert ionization produced in a semiconductor (like those found in computer chips) directly into an electrical signal. Semiconductors can be constructed that do not conduct current in one particular direction. When a voltage is applied in that direction, current flows only when ionization is produced by radiation, similar to what happens in a Geiger tube. Further, the amount of current in a solid-state detector is closely related to the energy deposited and, since the detector is solid, it can have a high efficiency (since ionizing radiation is stopped in a shorter distance in solids fewer particles escape detection). As with scintillators, very sophisticated information can be obtained from solid-state detectors.</p></section>
