<p id="eip-id1847606">The Earth acts like a very large bar magnet with its south-seeking pole near the geographic North Pole. That is why the north pole of your compass is attracted toward the geographic north pole of the Earth&#8212;because the magnetic pole that is near the geographic North Pole is actually a south magnetic pole! Confusion arises because the geographic term &#8220;North Pole&#8221; has come to be used (incorrectly) for the magnetic pole that is near the North Pole. Thus, &#8220;North magnetic pole&#8221; is actually a misnomer&#8212;it should be called the South magnetic pole.</p>
