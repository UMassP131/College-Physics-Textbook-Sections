    <p id="import-auto-id1616101">Only certain materials, such as iron, cobalt, nickel, and gadolinium, exhibit strong magnetic effects. Such materials are called <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1897071">ferromagnetic</span>, after the Latin word for iron, <em data-effect="italics">ferrum</em>. A group of materials made from the alloys of the rare earth elements are also used as strong and permanent magnets; a popular one is neodymium. Other materials exhibit weak magnetic effects, which are detectable only with sensitive instruments. Not only do ferromagnetic materials respond strongly to magnets (the way iron is attracted to magnets), they can also be <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1838766">magnetized</span> themselves&#8212;that is, they can be induced to be magnetic or made into permanent magnets.</p><figure id="import-auto-id2093834"><figcaption>An unmagnetized piece of iron is placed between two magnets, heated, and then cooled, or simply tapped when cold. The iron becomes a permanent magnet with the poles aligned as shown: its south pole is adjacent to the north pole of the original magnet, and its north pole is adjacent to the south pole of the original magnet. Note that there are attractive forces between the magnets.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="import-auto-id1732928" data-alt="An unmagnetized piece of iron is turned into a permanent magnet using heat and another magnet.">

What happens on a microscopic scale is illustrated in <a href="#import-auto-id1455300" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.

    <p id="import-auto-id1464843">Early in the 19th century, it was discovered that electrical currents cause magnetic effects. The first significant observation was by the Danish scientist Hans Christian Oersted (1777&#8211;1851), who found that a compass needle was deflected by a current-carrying wire. This was the first significant evidence that the movement of charges had any connection with magnets. <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id2206858">Electromagnetism</span> is the use of electric current to make magnets. These temporarily induced magnets are called <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1476064">electromagnets</span>. Electromagnets are employed for everything from a wrecking yard crane that lifts scrapped cars to controlling the beam of a 90-km-circumference particle accelerator to the magnets in medical imaging machines (See <a href="#import-auto-id1455228" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p><figure id="import-auto-id1455228"><figcaption>Instrument for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

    </figure><p id="import-auto-id1361787">Combining a ferromagnet with an electromagnet can produce particularly strong magnetic effects. (See <a href="#import-auto-id2579978" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.) Whenever strong magnetic effects are needed, such as lifting scrap metal, or in particle accelerators, electromagnets are enhanced by ferromagnetic materials. Limits to how strong the magnets can be made are imposed by coil resistance (it will overheat and melt at sufficiently high current), and so superconducting magnets may be employed. These are still limited, because superconducting properties are destroyed by too great a magnetic field.</p>

    <p id="import-auto-id2816553">An electromagnet creates magnetism with an electric current. In later sections we explore this more quantitatively, finding the strength and direction of magnetic fields created by various currents. But what about ferromagnets? <a href="#import-auto-id2071727" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows models of how electric currents create magnetism at the submicroscopic level. (Note that we cannot directly observe the paths of individual electrons about atoms, and so a model or visual image, consistent with all direct observations, is made. We can directly observe the electron&#8217;s orbital angular momentum, its spin momentum, and subsequent magnetic moments, all of which are explained with electric-current-creating subatomic magnetism.) Currents, including those associated with other submicroscopic particles like protons, allow us to explain ferromagnetism and all other magnetic effects. Ferromagnetism, for example, results from an internal cooperative alignment of electron spins, possible in some materials but not in others.</p><p id="import-auto-id1564818">Crucial to the statement that electric current is the source of all magnetism is the fact that it is impossible to separate north and south magnetic poles. (This is far different from the case of positive and negative charges, which are easily separated.) A current loop always produces a magnetic dipole&#8212;that is, a magnetic field that acts like a north pole and south pole pair. Since isolated north and south magnetic poles, called <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1524979">magnetic monopoles</span>, are not observed, currents are used to explain all magnetic effects. If magnetic monopoles did exist, then we would have to modify this underlying connection that all magnetism is due to electrical current. There is no known reason that magnetic monopoles should not exist&#8212;they are simply never observed&#8212;and so searches at the subnuclear level continue. If they do <em data-effect="italics">not</em> exist, we would like to find out why not. If they <em data-effect="italics">do</em> exist, we would like to see evidence of them.</p><div data-type="note" class="note" data-has-label="true" id="fs-id2679100" data-label=""><div data-type="title" class="title">Electric Currents and Magnetism</div>
