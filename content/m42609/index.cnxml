        <para id="import-auto-id3021018">High-resolution measurements of atomic and molecular spectra show that the spectral lines are even more complex than they first appear. In this section, we will see that this complexity has yielded important new information about electrons and their orbits in atoms.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id3353061">In order to explore the substructure of atoms (and knowing that magnetic fields affect moving charges), the Dutch physicist Hendrik Lorentz (1853–1930) suggested that his student Pieter Zeeman (1865–1943) study how spectra might be affected by magnetic fields. What they found became known as the <term id="import-auto-id2401718">Zeeman effect</term>, which involved spectral lines being split into two or more separate emission lines by an external magnetic field, as shown in <link target-id="import-auto-id2055078"/>. For their discoveries, Zeeman and Lorentz shared the 1902 Nobel Prize in Physics.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id2408772">Zeeman splitting is complex. Some lines split into three lines, some into five, and so on. But one general feature is that the amount the split lines are separated is proportional to the applied field strength, indicating an interaction with a moving charge. The splitting means that the quantized energy of an orbit is affected by an external magnetic field, causing the orbit to have several discrete energies instead of one. Even without an external magnetic field, very precise measurements showed that spectral lines are doublets (split into two), apparently by magnetic fields within the atom itself.</para>

In the third case, the magnetic field is large. The left line is again split into three lines and the right into five, but the split lines are farther apart than they are when the external magnetic field is not as strong.">

The number of lines formed varies, but the spread is proportional to the strength of the applied field. (a) Two spectral lines with no external magnetic field.

The external magnetic field and the orbital magnetic field interact; a torque is exerted to align them. A torque rotating a system through some angle does work so that there is energy associated with this interaction. Thus, orbits at different angles to the external magnetic field have different energies. What is remarkable is that the energies are quantized—the magnetic field splits the spectral lines into several discrete lines that have different energies. This means that only certain angles are allowed between the orbital angular momentum and the external field, as seen in <link target-id="import-auto-id1569430"/>.</para><figure xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" id="import-auto-id1186698"><media id="import-auto-id2403522" alt="The figure shows an electron traveling in a circular orbit with radius r.

        <caption>Only certain angles are allowed between the orbital angular momentum and an external magnetic field.

The new insight is that the <emphasis effect="italics">direction of the orbital angular momentum is also quantized</emphasis>. The fact that the orbital angular momentum can have only certain directions is called <term id="import-auto-id3094926">space quantization</term>. Like many aspects of quantum mechanics, this quantization of direction is totally unexpected. On the macroscopic scale, orbital angular momentum, such as that of the moon around the earth, can have any magnitude and be in any direction.</para>
        <para xmlns:q="http://cnx.rice.edu/qml/1.0" id="import-auto-id2956527">Detailed treatment of space quantization began to explain some complexities of atomic spectra, but certain patterns seemed to be caused by something else. As mentioned, spectral lines are actually closely spaced doublets, a characteristic called <term id="import-auto-id1410700">fine structure</term>, as shown in <link target-id="import-auto-id3116772"/>. The doublet changes when a magnetic field is applied, implying that whatever causes the doublet interacts with a magnetic field. In 1925, Sem Goudsmit and George Uhlenbeck, two Dutch physicists, successfully argued that electrons have properties analogous to a macroscopic charge spinning on its axis.

The spin of the electron can have only one magnitude, and its direction can be at only one of two angles relative to a magnetic field, as seen in <link target-id="import-auto-id1870582"/>. We refer to this as spin up or spin down for the electron. Each spin direction has a different energy; hence, spectroscopic lines are split into two.
