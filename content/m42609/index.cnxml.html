        <p id="import-auto-id3021018">High-resolution measurements of atomic and molecular spectra show that the spectral lines are even more complex than they first appear. In this section, we will see that this complexity has yielded important new information about electrons and their orbits in atoms.</p>
        <p id="import-auto-id3353061">In order to explore the substructure of atoms (and knowing that magnetic fields affect moving charges), the Dutch physicist Hendrik Lorentz (1853&#8211;1930) suggested that his student Pieter Zeeman (1865&#8211;1943) study how spectra might be affected by magnetic fields. What they found became known as the <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id2401718">Zeeman effect</span>, which involved spectral lines being split into two or more separate emission lines by an external magnetic field, as shown in <a href="#import-auto-id2055078" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. For their discoveries, Zeeman and Lorentz shared the 1902 Nobel Prize in Physics.</p>
        <p id="import-auto-id2408772">Zeeman splitting is complex. Some lines split into three lines, some into five, and so on. But one general feature is that the amount the split lines are separated is proportional to the applied field strength, indicating an interaction with a moving charge. The splitting means that the quantized energy of an orbit is affected by an external magnetic field, causing the orbit to have several discrete energies instead of one. Even without an external magnetic field, very precise measurements showed that spectral lines are doublets (split into two), apparently by magnetic fields within the atom itself.</p>

        
        <figure id="import-auto-id2055078"><figcaption>The Zeeman effect is the splitting of spectral lines when a magnetic field is applied. The number of lines formed varies, but the spread is proportional to the strength of the applied field. (a) Two spectral lines with no external magnetic field.

(c) The splitting is greater when a stronger field is applied.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="import-auto-id3177828" data-alt="The figure shows the effect of magnetic field on spectral lines.

A torque rotating a system through some angle does work so that there is energy associated with this interaction. Thus, orbits at different angles to the external magnetic field have different energies. What is remarkable is that the energies are quantized&#8212;the magnetic field splits the spectral lines into several discrete lines that have different energies.

The new insight is that the <em data-effect="italics">direction of the orbital angular momentum is also quantized</em>. The fact that the orbital angular momentum can have only certain directions is called <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id3094926">space quantization</span>. Like many aspects of quantum mechanics, this quantization of direction is totally unexpected. On the macroscopic scale, orbital angular momentum, such as that of the moon around the earth, can have any magnitude and be in any direction.</p>
        <p id="import-auto-id2956527">Detailed treatment of space quantization began to explain some complexities of atomic spectra, but certain patterns seemed to be caused by something else.

The doublet changes when a magnetic field is applied, implying that whatever causes the doublet interacts with a magnetic field. In 1925, Sem Goudsmit and George Uhlenbeck, two Dutch physicists, successfully argued that electrons have properties analogous to a macroscopic charge spinning on its axis.
