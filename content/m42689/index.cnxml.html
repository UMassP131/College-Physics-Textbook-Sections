        <p id="import-auto-id1169736684754">When we talk of black holes or the unification of forces, we are actually discussing aspects of general relativity and quantum gravity. We know from <a href="/contents/7372d4a4-085a-4018-8588-9801e44b636f@4">Special Relativity</a> that relativity is the study of how different observers measure the same event, particularly if they move relative to one another. Einstein&#8217;s theory of <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1169738007161">general relativity</span> describes all types of relative motion including accelerated motion and the effects of gravity. General relativity encompasses special relativity and classical relativity in situations where acceleration is zero and relative velocity is small compared with the speed of light. Many aspects of general relativity have been verified experimentally, some of which are better than science fiction in that they are bizarre but true. <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1169736769011">Quantum gravity</span> is the theory that deals with particle exchange of gravitons as the mechanism for the force, and with extreme conditions where quantum mechanics and general relativity must both be used. A good theory of quantum gravity does not yet exist, but one will be needed to understand how all four forces may be unified. If we are successful, the theory of quantum gravity will encompass all others, from classical physics to relativity to quantum mechanics&#8212;truly a Theory of Everything (TOE).</p><section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1169738073270"><h1 data-type="title">General Relativity</h1><p id="import-auto-id1169738250473">Einstein first considered the case of no observer acceleration when he developed the revolutionary special theory of relativity, publishing his first work on it in 1905. By 1916, he had laid the foundation of general relativity, again almost on his own. Much of what Einstein did to develop his ideas was to mentally analyze certain carefully and clearly defined situations&#8212;doing this is to perform a <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1169737784622">thought experiment</span>. <a href="#import-auto-id1169737820487" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> illustrates a thought experiment like the ones that convinced Einstein that light must fall in a gravitational field. Think about what a person feels in an elevator that is accelerated upward. It is identical to being in a stationary elevator in a gravitational field. The feet of a person are pressed against the floor, and objects released from hand fall with identical accelerations. In fact, it is not possible, without looking outside, to know what is happening&#8212;acceleration upward or gravity. This led Einstein to correctly postulate that acceleration and gravity will produce identical effects in all situations. So, if acceleration affects light, then gravity will, too. <a href="#import-auto-id1169737820487" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows the effect of acceleration on a beam of light shone horizontally at one wall. Since the accelerated elevator moves up during the time light travels across the elevator, the beam of light strikes low, seeming to the person to bend down. (Normally a tiny effect, since the speed of light is so great.) The same effect must occur due to gravity, Einstein reasoned, since there is no way to tell the effects of gravity acting downward from acceleration of the elevator upward. Thus gravity affects the path of light, even though we think of gravity as acting between masses and photons are massless.</p>

Since the elevator moves up during the time the light takes to reach the wall, the beam strikes lower than it would if the elevator were not accelerated. (b) Gravity has the same effect on light, since it is not possible to tell whether the elevator is accelerating upward or acted upon by gravity.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="import-auto-id1169737003446" data-alt="Figure a shows a person holding a flashlight and standing in an elevator that is accelerating upward.

        </figure><p id="import-auto-id1169737946298">Einstein&#8217;s theory of general relativity got its first verification in 1919 when starlight passing near the Sun was observed during a solar eclipse. (See <a href="#import-auto-id1169737804765" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.) During an eclipse, the sky is darkened and we can briefly see stars. Those in a line of sight nearest the Sun should have a shift in their apparent positions. Not only was this shift observed, but it agreed with Einstein&#8217;s predictions well within experimental uncertainties. This discovery created a scientific and public sensation. Einstein was now a folk hero as well as a very great scientist. The bending of light by matter is equivalent to a bending of space itself, with light following the curve. This is another radical change in our concept of space and time. It is also another connection that any particle with mass or energy (massless photons) is affected by gravity.</p>
        
            <p id="import-auto-id1169738163176">There are several current forefront efforts related to general relativity. One is the observation and analysis of gravitational lensing of light. Another is analysis of the definitive proof of the existence of black holes. Direct observation of gravitational waves or moving wrinkles in space is being searched for. Theoretical efforts are also being aimed at the possibility of time travel and wormholes into other parts of space due to black holes.</p>
        <p id="import-auto-id1169738076876"><span data-type="title"><strong>Gravitational lensing</strong></span>As you can see in <a href="#import-auto-id1169737804765" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, light is bent toward a mass, producing an effect much like a converging lens (large masses are needed to produce observable effects). On a galactic scale, the light from a distant galaxy could be &#8220;lensed&#8221; into several images when passing close by another galaxy on its way to Earth. Einstein predicted this effect, but he considered it unlikely that we would ever observe it. A number of cases of this effect have now been observed; one is shown in <a href="#import-auto-id1169738087364" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. This effect is a much larger scale verification of general relativity. But such gravitational lensing is also useful in verifying that the red shift is proportional to distance. The red shift of the intervening galaxy is always less than that of the one being lensed, and each image of the lensed galaxy has the same red shift. This verification supplies more evidence that red shift is proportional to distance. Confidence that the multiple images are not different objects is bolstered by the observations that if one image varies in brightness over time, the others also vary in the same manner.</p><figure id="import-auto-id1169737804765"><figcaption>This schematic shows how light passing near a massive body like the Sun is curved toward it. The light that reaches the Earth then seems to be coming from different locations than the known positions of the originating stars.

Bodies, like the Earth or the Sun, have what is called an <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1169737795895">escape velocity</span>. If an object moves straight up from the body, starting at the escape velocity, it will just be able to escape the gravity of the body.<sup/> The greater the acceleration of gravity on the body, the greater is the escape velocity. As long ago as the late 1700s, it was proposed that if the escape velocity is greater than the speed of light, then light cannot escape. Simon Laplace (1749&#8211;1827), the French astronomer and mathematician, even incorporated this idea of a dark star into his writings. But the idea was dropped after Young&#8217;s double slit experiment showed light to be a wave. For some time, light was thought not to have particle characteristics and, thus, could not be acted upon by gravity. The idea of a black hole was very quickly reincarnated in 1916 after Einstein&#8217;s theory of general relativity was published. It is now thought that black holes can form in the supernova collapse of a massive star, forming an object perhaps 10 km across and having a mass greater than that of our Sun. It is interesting that several prominent physicists who worked on the concept, including Einstein, firmly believed that nature would find a way to prohibit such objects.</p><p id="import-auto-id1169737754225">Black holes are difficult to observe directly, because they are small and no light comes directly from them.

The object itself is inside the event horizon.</p><p id="import-auto-id1169738249046">Physics near a black hole is fascinating. Gravity increases so rapidly that, as you approach a black hole, the tidal effects tear matter apart, with matter closer to the hole being pulled in with much more force than that only slightly farther away. This can pull a companion star apart and heat inflowing gases to the point of producing X rays. (See <a href="#import-auto-id1169737804920" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.) We have observed X rays from certain binary star systems that are consistent with such a picture. This is not quite proof of black holes, because the X rays could also be caused by matter falling onto a neutron star. These objects were first discovered in 1967 by the British astrophysicists, Jocelyn Bell and Anthony Hewish. <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1169737827022">Neutron stars</span> are literally a star composed of neutrons. They are formed by the collapse of a star&#8217;s core in a supernova, during which electrons and protons are forced together to form neutrons (the reverse of neutron <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>&#946;</mi></mrow><mrow/></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>&#946;</mi></mrow><mrow/></mrow><annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{&#946;} {}</annotation></semantics></annotation-xml></semantics></math> decay). Neutron stars are slightly larger than a black hole of the same mass and will not collapse further because of resistance by the strong force. However, neutron stars cannot have a mass greater than about eight solar masses or they must collapse to a black hole. With recent improvements in our ability to resolve small details, such as with the orbiting Chandra X-ray Observatory, it has become possible to measure the masses of X-ray-emitting objects by observing the motion of companion stars and other matter in their vicinity. What has emerged is a plethora of X-ray-emitting objects too massive to be neutron stars. This evidence is considered conclusive and the existence of black holes is widely accepted. These black holes are concentrated near galactic centers.</p>
        <p id="import-auto-id1169736987242">We also have evidence that supermassive black holes may exist at the cores of many galaxies, including the Milky Way. Such a black hole might have a mass millions or even billions of times that of the Sun, and it would probably have formed when matter first coalesced into a galaxy billions of years ago. Supporting this is the fact that very distant galaxies are more likely to have abnormally energetic cores. Some of the moderately distant galaxies, and hence among the younger, are known as <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1169738155969">quasars</span> and emit as much or more energy than a normal galaxy but from a region less than a light year across. Quasar energy outputs may vary in times less than a year, so that the energy-emitting region must be less than a light year across. The best explanation of quasars is that they are young galaxies with a supermassive black hole forming at their core, and that they become less energetic over billions of years. In closer superactive galaxies, we observe tremendous amounts of energy being emitted from very small regions of space, consistent with stars falling into a black hole at the rate of one or more a month. The Hubble Space Telescope (1994) observed an accretion disk in the galaxy M87 rotating rapidly around a region of extreme energy emission. (See <a href="#import-auto-id1169737804920" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.) A jet of material being ejected perpendicular to the plane of rotation gives further evidence of a supermassive black hole as the engine.</p><figure id="import-auto-id1169737804920"><figcaption>A black hole is shown pulling matter away from a companion star, forming a superheated accretion disk where X rays are emitted before the matter disappears forever into the hole. The in-fall energy also ejects some material, forming the two vertical spikes.

Since gravity is by far the weakest force, extreme conditions are needed to generate significant gravitational waves. Gravity near binary neutron star systems is so great that significant gravitational wave energy is radiated as the two neutron stars orbit one another. American astronomers, Joseph Taylor and Russell Hulse, measured changes in the orbit of such a binary neutron star system. They found its orbit to change precisely as predicted by general relativity, a strong indication of gravitational waves, and were awarded the 1993 Nobel Prize. But direct detection of gravitational waves on Earth would be conclusive. For many years, various attempts have been made to detect gravitational waves by observing vibrations induced in matter distorted by these waves. American physicist Joseph Weber pioneered this field in the 1960s, but no conclusive events have been observed. (No gravity wave detectors were in operation at the time of the 1987A supernova, unfortunately.) There are now several ambitious systems of gravitational wave detectors in use around the world. These include the LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory) system with two laser interferometer detectors, one in the state of Washington and another in Louisiana (See <a href="#import-auto-id1169737817031" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>) and the VIRGO (Variability of Irradiance and Gravitational Oscillations) facility in Italy with a single detector.</p></section><section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1169737946546"><h1 data-type="title">Quantum Gravity</h1>
        <p id="import-auto-id1169738087588"><span data-type="title"><strong>Black holes radiate</strong></span>Quantum gravity is important in those situations where gravity is so extremely strong that it has effects on the quantum scale, where the other forces are ordinarily much stronger. The early universe was such a place, but black holes are another. The first significant connection between gravity and quantum effects was made by the Russian physicist Yakov Zel&#8217;dovich in 1971, and other significant advances followed from the British physicist Stephen Hawking. (See <a href="#import-auto-id1169738088286" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.) These two showed that black holes could radiate away energy by quantum effects just outside the event horizon (nothing can escape from inside the event horizon). Black holes are, thus, expected to radiate energy and shrink to nothing, although extremely slowly for most black holes. The mechanism is the creation of a particle-antiparticle pair from energy in the extremely strong gravitational field near the event horizon. One member of the pair falls into the hole and the other escapes, conserving momentum. (See <a href="#import-auto-id1169737763804" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.) When a black hole loses energy and, hence, rest mass, its event horizon shrinks, creating an even greater gravitational field.

Theoretical physicists, such as the American Kip Thorne, have treated the subject seriously, looking into the possibility that falling into a black hole could result in popping up in another time and place&#8212;a trip through a so-called wormhole. Time travel and wormholes appear in innumerable science fiction dramatizations, but the consensus is that time travel is not possible in theory. While still debated, it appears that quantum gravity effects inside a black hole prevent time travel due to the creation of particle pairs.

        <p id="import-auto-id1169736852594">Consider a supermassive black hole near the center of a galaxy. Calculate the radius of such an object based on its mass. You must consider how much mass is reasonable for these large objects, and which is now nearly directly observed. (Information on black holes posted on the Web by NASA and other agencies is reliable, for example.)</p>
